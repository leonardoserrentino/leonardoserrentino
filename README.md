# Hello, Iâ€™m Leonardo! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a **Theoretical Computer Scientist** specializing in **Logic** and **Large Language Models (LLMs)**. My passion is to blend rigorous theoretical insights with cutting-edge AI development to solve challenging, real-world problems.

## What I Do 

- **Logic & Formal Methods**  
  With a solid foundation in mathematical logic and formal systems, I ensure my solutions are both theoretically sound and verifiable.  
- **Large Language Models**  
  I design and refine LLM-based architecturesâ€”ranging from advanced chatbots to domain-specific knowledge distillation pipelines. My goal is to push the boundaries of humanâ€“AI interaction.  
- **Bioinformatics**  
  From genomic data analysis to diagnostic prediction and beyond, I apply my expertise in data science and AI to uncover insights hidden in complex biological datasets.
- **Computer Vision**
